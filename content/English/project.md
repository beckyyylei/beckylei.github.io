## Based on Body Capture Suit and Deep Learning to Improve Equine-Assisted Therapy

*2024.01-2024.05 Python PyTorch RNN FNN*

> GitHub: https://github.com/YumingHuo/individual_project.git (**Private Now**)

* The deep learning model was developed and trained based on PyTorch, and the data was collected using the dynamic capture suit. FNN and RNN models were used respectively to realize the automatic identification of the emotional state of patients receiving treatment.
* Normalization of raw time series data, including padding, truncation, and feature normalization, to ensure data consistency and quality.
* Visualize the training results of FNN and RNN, as well as the confusion matrix of the RNN model, and visually show how the model's predictions compare to the actual situation.

*2022.06-2022.07 JavaScript Echarts Vue SpringBoot*

* Data processing: for data sets, calculate maximum and minimum values, mean, median, sum, variance, standard deviation, etc., and calculate similarity between two data sets, etc.
* Numerical analysis: analysis of variance, regression analysis, correlation analysis, cluster analysis, etc.
* Use tools such as Echarts, Vue, JavaScript, etc. to display the analysis results in a visual form on the web. Increase user interactivity and operability, such as adding filtering, sorting, searching and other functions.
