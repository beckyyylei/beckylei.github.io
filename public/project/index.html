Used tailwind CSS to beautify the web end and implemented dark mode. Use the A* algorithm to calculate the shortest route and optimal solution for the movement of the boxes, test and evaluate them.

Use data enhancement techniques to increase the diversity and quantity of the data set, such as rotation, flipping, scaling, and cropping. Use image processing libraries such as OpenCV and Pillow to implement data enhancement.
